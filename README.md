# exploration_kickstarter

This project explores a dataset of >150000 Kickstarter projects. Probably the most popular crowdfunding site. The dataset was obtained by querying directly the (undocumented) kickstarter API.The dataset contains information the project goal, the outcome (successfull, failed, how much was in the end pledged for, backers count), project location, the category, when it was created and also some extra information about the creator for a part of the projects. Can we use all this information to understand the recipe for a successful project?
